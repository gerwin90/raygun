# Octopus X Raygun demo website

This is a simple website that will generate some errors.

## Getting started
The latest built files are uploaded to the `dist/` directory. To open the site you can simply open `/dist/index.html`.

### To build changes:
The build pipeline requires grunt to be installed. More info can be found [here](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

1. Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/Olwiba/Webinar-website-example.git`
2. Open directory
`cd ./Webinar-website-example`
3. Install dependencies
`yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Run grunt
`grunt` - for a single build
`grunt dev` - for continuous building on file changes
5. Done, built files found in `dist/` ðŸŽ‰
